# Well Fargo competition
## Campus Analytics Challenge: Live Green and Live Happy
Promoting environmental sustainability is one of priorities of Wells Fargo. We want to make a low-carbon economy society and we need to adjust individual's actions to reduce the carbon produced. This competition encourage students in campus using machine learning skills to help find the new balance between carbon footprint and quality of life. We want to encourage individuals adjust their actions and reduce the carcon footprint without losing quality of life.

I participate the competition due to my interest in both environment issues and mahcine learning. Following is the practice to explore data. 

* data.csv - individual's daily activities
* carbMap - the carbon footprint for each activities
* dataExplore.ipynb - explore the data
* solution.ipynb - use machine learning skills to find the new balance between carbons reduction and quality of life
