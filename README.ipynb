# Deep-Learning-Practice

I practice the data analytics tools and deep learning skills by exploring data which I interested in. I exploring and analyze data like tree cover classification, tree/flower recognition, weather prediction, news influence prediction, hand-written digit recognition, and environment substainability issues. Some of the data cannot be released. In this respository, I only show my pratice on data from public web sites.
