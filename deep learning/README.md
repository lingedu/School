# Deep Learning Practice

In this repository, I use deep learnging model to make the classification for [the MINST data set](https://github.com/hsjeong5/MNIST-for-Numpy) witch including more than 60,000 hand-written digits.

In this repository, I implement Multi-Layer neural network by scratch with Numpy. I also practice to implement the neural network by Pytorch and Karas. Besides of Multi-Layer model, I also using convolutionary neuraul network (CNN) which is a popular skills in image classification to compare their performance.
