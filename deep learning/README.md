# Deep Learning Practice
MNIST is a popular hand-written digits database which are often taken as a good practice subject for beginners in deep leanrning. 

In this repository, I practice some basic deep learnging models to predict the hand-written digits. 
I implement Multi-Layer neural network by scratch with Numpy. I also practice to implement the neural network by Pytorch and Karas. Besides of Multi-Layer model, I also using convolutionary neraul network (CNN) which is a popular skills in image classification to compare their performace.
